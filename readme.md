[![Hits](https://hits.sh/github.com/vmsaif/block_chain_hashing.svg?label=Visits&color=100b75)](https://hits.sh/github.com/vmsaif/block_chain_hashing/)

A Java program that implements a MerkleTree to be used in a blockchain.

## What I Learned

In this project, I learned about:

- Blockchain technology and how it works
- Merkle Trees and their use in Blockchain
- Implementing algorithms and methods in Java, including:
  - Building a Merkle Tree from transactions
  - Adding a block to a Blockchain
  - Solving the Proof-of-Work puzzle
  - Validating the integrity of a Blockchain if a block is corrupted

## Running the Code

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) and JavaFX installed on your machine.
2. Install VSCode.
3. Install this VSCode Extension Pack for Java from [here](vscode:extension/vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
4. Git clone this repository from VSCode
5. From the explorer, open src\main\java\blockchain_hashing\BLOCKCHAIN.java
6. Click run button from the top right corner area. 

If your are having trouble with the environment installation, refer [here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java)
