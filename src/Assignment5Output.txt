The Bitcoin blockchain is created.
Block reward is 5000000000 satoshis per block paid to the block's miner.
There will be (approx.) 600000 miliseconds between two blocks
Block reward halves every 210K blocks (takes around 4 years)
The Peer-to-Peer network will be fake; we will simulate it.
The blockchain will end once the block 10 is mined.
MemPool contained 68 transactions.
The coinbase transaction is created by the miner, and added to the block.
